# Data Analyst Portfolio

This project contains a simple portfolio site built with HTML and Tailwind CSS. The
page showcases skills, dashboards, and a list of projects loaded from `projects.json`.

## Running Locally

Serve the files with any static server. For example, using Python:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
